* Removing already patched node or a set of patched nodes by removing their parent.
* Assigning configuration roles to any patched node, nodes or their parents.
    * **Note:** more information about patching rules you can find [here](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/91/platform-administration-and-architecture/en/rule-based-configuration.html).
* Preview the final configuration (showconfig) with already applied changes (do not affect current Sitecore configuration).
* Remove all patched nodes in a single click.
* Wide the list of supported browsers.
